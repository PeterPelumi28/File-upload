            <h3>Introduction </h3>
            <p>In recent years, social media has emerged as a dominant force in the lives of young people worldwide, particularly in Nigeria. With the proliferation of smartphones and internet access, platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp have transformed communication and information sharing among students. As these digital spaces become increasingly integrated into daily routines, their potential impact on academic performance is a growing concern. Social media offers numerous benefits, including access to vast educational resources, collaborative learning opportunities, and the ability to connect with peers for academic support. However, it also presents challenges, such as distractions, procrastination, and a decline in face-to-face interactions. Understanding the dual nature of social media is crucial for educators, parents, and students alike.
